Description
This project involves various steps to analyze and predict home prices. The key steps include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the structure, distribution, and relationships within the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve the model's predictive power.

Feature Selection: Identifying the most important features that contribute to the prediction.

Model Creation: Building and training machine learning models to predict house prices.
